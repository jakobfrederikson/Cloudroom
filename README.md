# Project Description

Cloudroom is being developed by two second year students, Jay and Jakob, from the Bachelor of Software Engineering class at Yoobee Colleges, Wellington.

## What does Cloudroom do?

Cloudroom is still in development. There are two versions of Cloudroom; the teacher side, and the student side.

### Teacher Side

- create classrooms/subjects
- create papers for those classrooms (e.g. **Classroom**: Software Engineering, **Paper**: Python 203)
- add students to papers
- view your dashboard and see what papers you're teaching
- upload your important files to the drive
- create posts that your students can view and comment on
- create, view and grade assignments for students
- create programming questions using our in-built code editor

### Student Side

- view your dashboard, and see all papers you're enrolled in
- upload your school notes and any files to the drive
- discuss class content with your peers on classroom posts
- view, complete and submit all of your assignments in one organised place
- view all of your grades for each paper

# Technologies used

- HTML/CSS/JS
- Python
- Flask
- Codemirror

# How to install

1. Make sure your machine has the latest version of python installed.
2. Clone this repository somewhere on your computer.
3. Open a terminal and make sure your path is within the 'Cloudroom' folder. (an example of a path on windows: 'C:\\github\\Cloudroom>')
4. Install all dependencies with:

```
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. Making sure you're still in the same path, type 'python run.py'. This should launch a server on your computer which will host Cloudroom for you to play around with.
6. Sign up! Create your own user and play around with what we have created so far.
