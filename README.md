Online learning made to feel like a breeze.

# Project Description
Cloudroom is being developed by two second year students, Jay and Jakob, from the Bachelor of Software Engineering class at Yoobee Colleges, Wellington.  
## What does Cloudroom do?
Cloudroom is still being developed. Currently, you can:
- create an account
- create classrooms
- create papers for those classrooms (e.g. __Classroom__: Software Engineering, __Paper__: Python 203)
- add students to papers
- view your dashboard, and see all papers you're enrolled in
- upload files to the drive
- view all of your grades for each paper
## Technologies used
- HTML/CSS/JS
- Python
- Flask
- Codemirror (in future iterations)

# How to install
1. Make sure your machine has the latest version of python installed.  
2. Clone this repository somewhere on your computer.
3. Open a terminal and make sure your path is within the 'Cloudroom' folder. (an example of a path on windows: 'C:\\github\\Cloudroom>')
4. Type 'pip install -r requirements.txt' to install all of the required dependencies.
5. While still in the same path, type 'python run.py'. This should launch a server on your computer which will host Cloudroom for you to play around with.
6. Sign up! Create your own user and play around with what we have created so far.
